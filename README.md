# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel

I'm a Software Developer, especially in the Back End Developer. I have skills in the Java programming language using the Spring Boot and Quarkus, and Javascript using NodeJS (Express JS) and don't forget basic concepts such as fundamentals, Object Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures. I'm a person who likes challenges, so I don't mind if there are new things.
